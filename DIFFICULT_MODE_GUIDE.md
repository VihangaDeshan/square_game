# 🔥 Difficult Mode - Complete Guide

## Overview
Difficult Mode is the ultimate challenge that combines expanding grid sizes with dynamic color shuffling, making it exponentially harder than regular modes.

## 🎯 Core Mechanics

### 1. Expanding Grid System
The grid size increases as you progress through levels:

| Levels | Grid Size | Total Cards | Pairs to Match | Bonus Square |
|--------|-----------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1-3    | 3×3       | 9           | 4              | ✅ Center    |
| 4-6    | 4×4       | 16          | 8              | ❌ None      |
| 7-9    | 5×5       | 25          | 12             | ✅ Center    |
| 10+    | 6×6       | 36          | 18             | ❌ None      |

**Note:** Odd grids (3×3, 5×5) have a bonus square in the center that's auto-matched.

### 2. Color Shuffling Feature
**THIS IS WHAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT!**

Every time you successfully match a pair:
- ✅ The matched pair stays visible
- 🔄 **ALL other unmatched cards shuffle their colors!**
- 🧠 Your memorized positions become invalid
- 🎲 You must adapt and re-memorize constantly

**Example:**
```
1. You memorize: Red at position 1, Blue at position 3
2. You match Yellow pair successfully
3. 🔄 SHUFFLE! Red and Blue swap to different positions
4. You must find the new positions!
```

## ⏱️ Time Limits

- **45 seconds per level** (more than regular time mode)
- Larger grids need more time
- Each successful match triggers a shuffle, adding complexity
- Timer continues during color shuffle animation

## 🌟 Bonus Lives

### Starting Lives
- Begin each level with **1 bonus life**

### Using Lives
When time runs out:
- Automatically grants **10 extra seconds**
- Life is consumed
- No additional lives for perfect games in difficult mode

## 🎮 Peeking Feature

- **3-second peek at level start**
- ALL cards flip face-up to show positions
- After 3 seconds, cards flip back
- ⚠️ Remember: Colors will shuffle after EVERY match!

## 💯 Scoring System

### Base Points
- **150 points** per match (higher than other modes)
- Level multiplier: Level × 75

### Time Bonus
- **15 points** per remaining second

### Shuffle Penalty
- **-5 points** per color shuffle
- More shuffles = more difficult = slight penalty

### Formula
```
Score = (Matches × 150) + (Level × 75) + (TimeRemaining × 15) - (Shuffles × 5)
```

## 🎯 Strategy Tips

### Level 1-3 (3×3 Grid)
- **Easy start** - Only 4 pairs
- Use the peek wisely
- Remember: Colors shuffle after each match
- Try to group pairs mentally by location

### Level 4-6 (4×4 Grid)
- **Medium challenge** - 8 pairs, NO bonus square
- All 16 cards must be matched
- Shuffles happen more frequently
- Focus on one section at a time

### Level 7-9 (5×5 Grid)
- **Hard challenge** - 12 pairs
- Bonus square helps slightly
- Many shuffles to handle
- Keep calm and adapt quickly

### Level 10+ (6×6 Grid)

- No bonus square
- 36 cards to track
- Master-level memory required

## 🧠 Pro Strategies

### 1. Memory Grouping
- Don't memorize exact positions

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Color Shuffling is NOT random**
   - Same color pairs still exist
   - Only their positions change
   - Number of pairs remains constant

2. **Bonus Square Behavior**
   - Bonus square NEVER shuffles
   - Always stays at center
   - Only in odd grids (3×3, 5×5)

3. **Memory Challenge**
   - Can't rely on initial peek
   - Must constantly re-adapt
   - True test of working memory
